										<h1>On "Voluntary Governments"</h1>
										<h3>Government runs on spaghetti code</h3>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/papers 1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>This <a href="https://1729.com/">recent 1729</a> piece <a href="https://1729.com/voluntary-governments">on voluntary governments</a> touches on the key issue I faced in my nearly three years at a government innovation office: the slow iterations of government and its inability to innovate. Cycles are slow. There is no space or time to pull back, to test. During the rare moments when new projects are even possible, the nature of bureaucracy and the electoral cycle makes them be planned to the last detail, with no room for iteration. </p>
									<p>Palmer mentions three "soft" inventions: writing, money, and software. I would add a fourth: law. Law is a kind of analog code. When looking at our office's procurement code and the documents produced along the process, I was struck by how code-like it all seemed. The first few pages of any document included long paragraphs "importing" modules, listing the legal precedents that allowed us to, say, purchase Internet for a school district: </p>
									<blockquote>The Constitution creates and empowers the Ministry of Education → The Ministry of Education has a role to play in school infrastructure according to Bill #123 → Bill #456 creates an Innovation Office → Bill #789 grants said Office a budget for purchasing Internet under ABC (but not under XYZ) conditions → Circular #321 allows schools to enter into agreements with the central government → and so on and so forth until we finally execute the line of code that says "buy Internet". </blockquote>
									<p>There are if and while structures, for-loops, and even variables. But nobody looks after this code. It is often written by parliaments and then forgotten. It is rarely updated and has developed a thick mesh over decades. Government runs on spaghetti code.</p>
									<p>The example above was real: at the Chilean Ministry of Education I ran a large government tender to purchase better Internet for schools. Chile, in case you don't know, has the least corrupt, most nimble bureaucracy in Latin America, as shown by <a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/chile/">a speedy vaccination program</a> that has outpaced even the US. But even in Chile, the tender process is so slow and so complicated that in a 4-year term we only got one shot at it. If something went wrong, the whole program would fall apart. As much as these limits allowed, I tried to build in some sort of feedback into the structure. I added a preliminary design-thinking process to bring in the perspectives of schools and Internet service providers, and built a staged roll-out that would give us some chance to fix problems as they appeared. But we were limited by the legal procurement process itself.</p>
									<p>At least buying Internet is a relatively straightforward, concrete product. Services and content are even tougher. I had to build several government websites with educational content. The political appointees above us were primarily concerned with launching the sites, ticking off the boxes, so they could mention them in a speech. The civil servants below us were concerned with whether the funds were executed, again ticking off the boxes, so as to secure their department's budget for next year. (In most governments around the world, bureaucratic rules reward you for successfully spending money, not for saving it.) Nobody in this machine was concerned with whether the websites were usable, whether they gained users, etc. This was not their fault, they were well-meaning public servants who understood the importance of drawing in teachers and students. But their work incentives, the actual metrics by which they would be praised or punished, pulled them away.</p>
									<p>To make government innovative, to allow for iteration, we don't necessarily need a more agile way of flipping between administrations or a way to test policies in VR (though that is an exciting idea). We first need to cut away at this underbrush of legacy code, to allow better incentives and iteration within the hundreds of government offices that already exist. </p>
